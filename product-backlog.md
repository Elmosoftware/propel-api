# Propel Changelog
Not a real product Backlog here, but just a way to note on some interesting ideas for the future that were not included in the last version.

## Replace Quick Task by Script Running
The option “Quick Task” must be removed and replaced by a “Run” button at the side of each script.

## Scripts usage.
This is about to display in which workflows each script is been used. Natural candidate to show this information is the “Browse scripts” and in the Script form itself.

## Export execution results.
Allows the users to export the execution results.

## Release What's new popup
Show a popup dialog every new Propel release to each user until get’s closed. We must show in the popup the new features of the release.

## Deprecate/Remove Legacy Security mode
Regular auth must be the only way for Propel Phase I.
